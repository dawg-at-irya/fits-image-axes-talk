Plan of action for talk on displaying images with WCS info in matplotlib

* Tidying up the repo
- [X] Export the notebook to markdown
- [ ] Add it to the README

  
** Export the notebook to markdown
#+begin_src bash :dir ../notebooks
jupyter nbconvert --to markdown dawgi_fits_image.ipynb
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:

* Where to keep the data
- I had thought of zenodo but that is overkill and inflexible
  - I have to decide ahead of time what all the files are before uploading them
- Current plan is to put the data in this repo, and then use guthub raw links to load them into Colab notebook
  - https://github.com/dawg-at-irya/fits-image-axes-talk/raw/main/data/large-image-no-wcs.fits
* Questions about talk structure
- Should I include WCS from FITS file first, or made by hand?
- 
- 
** Further topics
- Plotting points on the image
- Plotting contours on top of the image
  - Including using a different WCS
- Rotated pixel axes
- Non-linear transformations
