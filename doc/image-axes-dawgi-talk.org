Plan of action for talk on displaying images with WCS info in matplotlib

* Where to keep the data
- I had thought of zenodo but that is overkill and inflexible
  - I have to decide ahead of time what all the files are before uploading them
- Current plan is to put the data in this repo, and then use guthub raw links to load them into Colab notebook
  
* Talk outline
